actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. first we must implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
as a temporary solution, we can build a prototype, using existing tools.

ViFM + i3 and Xdotools (to create modal key bindings, and to know about existence of a window) + Konqueror (and Kparts for Katr, Konsole, Okular, Gwenview)
