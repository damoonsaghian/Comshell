actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. first we must implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
as a temporary solution, we can build a prototype, using existing tools.

Vifm
i3 (to create modal key bindings)
xdotool (to know about existence of a window or workspace)

= Arch Linux
Arch Linux provides a binary/shared library distribution system (Pacman and AUR) which is very close to the original build process.

boot to an existing Arch Linux (installed or live) then:
$ timedatectl set-ntp true
prepare the disk (use lsblk to identify the block devices), and mount it:
  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdx
  $ mount /dev/sdx /mnt
$ pacstrap /mnt grub sed intel-ucode linux systemd-sysvcompat btrfs-progs dhcpcd pacman nano man-db logrotate xorg-server xorg-xinit xf86-video-intel xf86-video-nouveau xf86-video-amdgpu i3-wm xdotool vifm ttf-roboto ttf-hack rustup
$ arch-chroot /mnt
bootloader:
  $ grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx
  $ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
$ systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
$ exit; reboot

btrfs is used because journaling file systems can only protect metadata at an acceptable performance, since they need to write all file system operations twice, once to the journal, and once to the file system.
copy'on'write provides consistency for both data and metadata.
also, it can offer integrity of data and metadata (using checksums), at an acceptable overhead.
in addition, c'o'w also supports the creation of cheap snapshots and clones (because it does not overwrite data in place). users can take fast online backups without the need to use any special software technique like l'v'm.

$ timedatectl set-ntp true
$ systemctl edit getty@tty1
