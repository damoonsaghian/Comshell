actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. first we must implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
but as a demonstration, we can build a prototype, using existing tools.

Rust + Streams + GTK

keep related states in one place (to avoid copying big data).
a set of messages as input.
each kind of message changes one part of the state.

= Arch Linux
Arch Linux provides a binary/shared library distribution system, which is very close to the original build process.

boot to an existing Arch Linux (installed or live) then:
$ timedatectl set-ntp true
prepare the disk (use lsblk to identify the block devices), and mount it:
  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdx
  $ mount /dev/sdx /mnt
  btrfs is used because journaling file systems can only protect metadata, at an acceptable performance. since they need to write all file system operations twice, once to the journal, and once to the file system.
  copy'on'write provides consistency for both data and metadata.
  also, it can offer integrity of data and metadata (using checksums), at an acceptable overhead.
  in addition, c'o'w also supports the creation of cheap snapshots and clones (because it does not overwrite data in place). users can take fast online backups without the need to use any special software technique like l'v'm.
