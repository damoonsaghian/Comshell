actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. first we must implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
as a temporary solution, we can use Rust futures, and GTK, to build a prototype of Comshell.

as others have noticed too, using GTK call'backs in Rust is ugly. it's not the problem of Rust. this difficulty is due to imperetive programming.

that's exactly what i like about Rust. it doesn't sacrifice a correct design, to implement a popular mistake (imperetive programming).
