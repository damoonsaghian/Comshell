we can use Atom text editor to create a prototype of Comshell;

one pane per project;
only the active project's pane is displayed, others will be hidden;
state of each project pane is stored/restored to/from ".cache/atom-pane";
state of buffers in each project pane is stored/restored to/from
 files in ".cache/atom-buffers/" directory;
name of the file storing a buffer's state,
 is made from path, replacing path seperators (ie "/") with "#";
