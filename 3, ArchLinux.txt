using Arch Linux we can easily setup and maintain a Linux system;
the following shows how to setup a basic graphical environment;
in the installed system, there is only one application, a terminal emulator;
other applications can be installed using "pacman";
you can press "alt-space" to show the list of applications;
selecting an application from the list shows it in a dedicated workspace;
other than applications, there are entries to
  power off, restart, logout, suspend, or lock the system;
press "alt-esc" to close the focused window;
press "alt-tab" or "alt-a" to cycle through workspaces or windows, respectively;

boot Arch Linux live environment;
to ensure the system clock is accurate:
; timedatectl set-ntp true
if you need to connect to a WIFI network:
; iwctl
  device list
  station <device> get-networks
  station <device> connect <SSID>

list available block devices using "lsblk", then on the intended block device,
  create the needed partitions, and finally format and mount them:
; printf "label: gpt\n,260MiB,U,*\n;" | sfdisk /dev/<device>
; mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/<partition1>; mkfs.btrfs /dev/<partition2>
; mount /dev/<partition2> /mnt
; mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
; mount /dev/<partition1> /mnt/boot/efi
; mkdir /mnt/etc
; genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

;sh
pacstrap /mnt base
arch-chroot /mnt
curl --proto '=https' -sSf -o comshell.zip https://github.com/damoonsaghian/Comshell/archive/master.zip
pacman -S unzip
unzip comshell.zip -d Comshell
;
ensure the downloaded files aren't malicious, then:
; cd Comshell/ArchLinux
; sh install.sh
; exit; reboot

to connect to a WIFI network:
; nmcli dev wifi
; nmcli --ask dev wifi con <ssid>
to disconnect from a WIFI network:
; nmcli con down id <ssid>

you can set "user1" for automatic login (using the root terminal):
; systemctl edit getty@tty1
  [Service]
  ExecStart=
  ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin user1 --noclear %I $TERM
but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot from USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep in mind that
  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;

= system administration
in system administration we must ensure that:
1, the command executed is explicitly given by the user;
2, if a program steals a "wheel" user's password, it can't change the system;

"sudo" fails in both cases;
"https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/"

"pkexec" is safer, but since the Polkit agent doesn't show command arguments,
  it can be vulnerable too;
further more, "pkexec" fails in the second case;
  a fake Polkit agent can be used to send the stolen password to Polkit;
and since Polkit admin is installed and active by default,
  we have to disable it to protect the system:
; mkdir -p /etc/polkit-1/rules.d
; echo 'polkit.addAdminRule(function(action, subject) { return []; });' >
  /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-rootpw_global.rules

always use a different password for root; because "su" is always present in a Linux system,
  and since it fails in both cases, it can be used to take over the system;

the solution is a program which opens a Wayland window with a command prompt;
if you have given your command as arguments to the program,
  the prompt shows that command, as default input;
after pressing "return", it asks for the user's password (user must be in wheel group);

= automatic online atomic upgrades
"https://www.techrapid.uk/2017/04/automatically-update-arch-linux-with-systemd.html"
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers"

to have reliable automatic updates, they must be atomic;

"usr", "etc" and "boot" must be symlinks to subvolumes;
create a base directory;
create snapshots of "usr", "etc" and "boot", then mount them in the base directory;
for the rest of system root directories make symlinks in the base directory;
chroot and upgrade;
remove the base directory;
change the "usr", "etc" and "boot" symlinks in the system root,
  to point to the new snapshots;
