as a temporary solution something like Comshell can already be arranged using Atom editor.

open files of a project in the current tab (even if it is open in another tab).
open external files (websites, pdf, ...) in an adjacent tab.
we can have different views of a project in separate windows, all put together in tabs, inside the project's workspace.

change project-plus such that it lists projects in a directory alphabetically (like project-jump).

discrete scrolling, no partial paragraphs


Comshell looks for projects in "~/projects/" and "/projects/".
a shared project directory can be created like this:
  mkdir /projects; chmod a+w /projects
