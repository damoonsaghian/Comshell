obviously implementing Comshell is a lot of work. fortunately Atom editor provides an a'p'i which can be used as a temporary solution.

project manager:
, open files of a project in the current tab (even if it is open in another tab).
, search all disks for a directory named "projects".

file browser:
, thumbnails for images an videos
, select files by typing
, when a file is opened, a new pane is created at right, showing the file.
, the active file is always visible and highlighted.

text editor:
, discrete scrolling
, do not show incomplete paragraphs.

we can have different views of a project in different tabs.
make tabs smaller, and visible only if more than one.

external files (websites, pdf, ...) will be opened in a panel which comes up to show the document, and is visible only in that tab. to get back to the editor tab, the panel will be minimized, showing only the title of open documents.

subtitle for videos

Comshell looks for projects in "~/projects/" and "/projects/".
a shared project directory can be created like this:
  mkdir /projects; chmod a+w /projects
