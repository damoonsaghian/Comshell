creating an actor from a struct itself made of actors: tree of actors;
user input is feeded to the root GUI actor;
each actor decides if it's going to apply the recieved input, or pass it to its children;
other sources (like a timer) can be feeded to any actor in the tree;

implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
  and existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
so we have to bend our design to fit in the single_treaded event_driven nature of GTK;
instead of a tree of actors, we use a tree of ordinary data structures;
these structs store the widgets, and other states like focus index;
they implement methods to set the size and location of their children,
  and methods to decide what to do with the received key_press events;

keyboard focus is alway on root window, it must be disabled for other widgets;

some structs store mode state;
when they recieve "Esc" key, they activate the normal mode, and pss the key to their children;
