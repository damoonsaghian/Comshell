implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded, thus we can't create actors from them;
so for data structures containing widgets we have to:
, use "RefCell", where you want mutability;
, use "Rc" to create references;
now although we can access actors from GTK main loop,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
so we either must write traditional single threaded code, without actors,
  or use a trick to access non_send data, in other threads:

considering these difficulties, i think it's better to put Rust aside for now,
  and use Gjs to build a prototype of Comshell;
