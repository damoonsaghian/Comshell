implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
so although we can access actors from GTK thread,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
thus we are forced back to traditional single threaded code, without actors;
in addition, there is still no GTK bindings for Pony;
so i think it's better to first build a prototype of Comshell, using LGI;

to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot form USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but not impossible;
physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;
