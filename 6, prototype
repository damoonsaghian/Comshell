implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
so although we can access actors from GTK thread,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
thus we are forced back to traditional single threaded code, without actors;
in addition, there is still no GTK bindings for Pony;
so i think it's better to first build a prototype of Comshell, using GJS and GorillaScript;

to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot from USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but not impossible;
physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;

; mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell
; su
lock user's extension directory (for security reasons);
; mkdir /home/user1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
; touch /home/user1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/0
; cp -r prototype/gnome-shell-improved/ /usr/local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
; exit

in "gnome-shell-improved":
, remove status bar;
, spawn "gjs /usr/local/etc/comshell-proto/comshell.js"
