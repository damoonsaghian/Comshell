the problem of shared mutable data is so pervasive in the computing world;
we can also see it in file synchronization tools like Git:
, there can be conflicts when pushing or pulling, that must be resolved manually;
, the history just grows indefinitely cause change in the history of the repository can be catastrophic;

solution:
only the owner can mutate the repository;
owner can mutably borrow the repository for a defined duration, or move ownership;
others have to send messages:
, in the form of to_dos define by the owner;
, corrections

immutable repositories can apply corrections and to_dos, and test them,
  but they can't push it to remote, only the owner can;
automatic sync at the immutable ends;
sync before sending to_dos or corrections;

delete old and big history;
for text files at least keep the last version (for diffing);
for binaries delete all;
clone only the last version;
git shallow clones
git partial clones

Gitlab:

push_to_create creates private repositories, and there is no push_options to make them public, yet;
also we can't remove repositories;
so we must use push options for gitlab ci/cd;
