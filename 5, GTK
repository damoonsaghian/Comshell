implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
  and existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded, and thus can't be used directly inside actors;
however there is a trick to access non_send data like widgets, in other threads:
  "https://github.com/Phaiax/gtk-rs-state"
so here is what we do:
, we can always create actors from data structures that implement "Send";
, for data structs containing widgets, to make other fields mutable we use RefCell,
  and instead of making actors from them, we use Rc,
  and then using the above trick we can access them from actors;

the problem with GTK is that
  i can't figure out how to store/restore an editor's state (undo history);
