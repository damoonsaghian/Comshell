implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded, thus we can't create actors from them;
so although we can access actors from GTK main loop,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
thus we are forced back to traditional single threaded code, without actors;
in fact there is a trick to access non_send data, in other threads:
  "https://github.com/Phaiax/gtk-rs-state",
  but i don't think it's suitable to structure the whole program on it;

so we will use special structs annotated by "#[derive(Clone)]", and made of:
, Gobjects
, other special structs
, Rc<RefCell> of normal Rust structs
