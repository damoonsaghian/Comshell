implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
so although we can access actors from GTK main loop,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
thus we are forced back to traditional single threaded code, without actors;
in addition, there is still no GTK bindings for Pony;
so i think it's better to first build a prototype of Comshell, using LGI;
