project manager:
, open files of a project in the current tab (even if it is open in another tab).
, search all disks for a directory named "projects".

file browser:
, thumbnails for images an videos
, select files by typing
, when a file is opened, a new pane is created at right, showing the file.
, the active file is always visible and highlighted.

text editor:
, discrete scrolling
, do not show incomplete paragraphs.

we can have different views of a project in different tabs.
external files (websites, pdf, ...) will be opened in an adjacent tab.
tabs bar is visible only if there are more than one tab.

Comshell looks for projects in "~/projects/" and "/projects/".
a shared project directory can be created like this:
  mkdir /projects; chmod a+w /projects

obviously implementing Comshell is a lot of work. fortunately Atom editor provides just the right a'p'i, which can be used as a temporary solution.
