collaborative development

we will have three BTRFS snapshots in a project's ".cache/coldev" directory:
, pristine
, indexed
, remote

index file:
".cache/coldev/indexed/index"
entries are separated with empty lines;
each entry has 3 lines:
, path
, modification time
, hash

push:
, if a file named "lock" exists at the remote, and it's younger than 20 seconds, exit;
, create a Cron job at the server that after this process finishes,
  it deletes files which are not in the index file;
, pull then if something must be done, unlock the remote and exit;
, snapshot the working directory into ".cache/coldev/remote" and ".cache/coldev/temp";
, flatten the paths of all files in ".cache/coldev/temp" using their hashes for the file names;
  if the file's modification time is the same as the one in the index file,
  take the hash from the index file, otherwise calculate the hash;
, move ".cache/coldev/temp" to ".cache/coldev/indexed";
, sync up ".cache/coldev/indexed" (using LFTP), without deleting any file at the remote;
, create the index file inside ".cache/coldev/indexed";
, create a file named "lock" in the remote;
, if index file in remote is not the same as the one in ".cache/coldev/remote", exit;
  because it means that some one else has pushed sooner, and you must pull it before pushing;
, send ".cache/coldev/indexed" to the remote;
, remove the lock file;
, delete those remote files which are not in index file;
, snapshot the ".cache/coldev/remote" into ".cache/coldev/pristine";

pull:
, sync down into ".cache/coldev/indexed", snapshot it to ".cache/coldev/temp";
, rename the files in ".cache/coldev/temp" based on the index file;
, delete the index file;
, move ".cache/coldev/temp" to ".cache/coldev/remote";
, show the diff based on the working directory, pristine and remote;

backup:
, copy the

SFTP:
, create a user with a temporary password;
, login, then disable multi login;
, reset ssh;
, login;
, make a homepage;
, put the fingerprint in "ssh_fingerprint.txt";
, change password;
, logout
create a key pair, and copy the public key to the server:
"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server"
each time before login download the ssh key fingerprint, and append it to "~/.ssh/known_hosts";

we can put tags like "//tag_name//" or "#tag_name#" in different places inside files;
messages are attached to these tags;
".cache/messages/"

files in ".cache" directory will not be synced;
so build directories must be put inside ".cache"; eg for Rust:
; nano ~/.cargo/config
  [build]
  target-dir = ".cache/cargo"
