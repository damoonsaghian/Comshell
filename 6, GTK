implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
thus we can't use them in a multi_threaded executer;
the solution:
"https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/source/fn.idle_add.html"
"https://docs.rs/fragile/1.0.0/fragile/struct.Fragile.html"
"https://docs.rs/send_wrapper/0.4.0/send_wrapper/"
we implement a wrapper named "Grap" which embeds a Fragile inside;
the Fragile will be created in GTK main thread (using "idle_add"),
  and then received (and put inside the Grap) using a channel;
