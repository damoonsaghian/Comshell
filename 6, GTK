implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded, thus we can't create actors from them;
so although we can access actors from GTK main loop,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
thus we are forced back to traditional single threaded code, without actors;
in fact there is a trick to access non_send data, in other threads:

  but i don't think it's suitable for structuring the whole program;
