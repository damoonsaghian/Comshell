sharing mutable data,
  ie having a mutable reference to some data, while it is shared using other references,
  is the root of many complexities;
"https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/"

to prevent sharing mutable data we can:
1, abandon aliasing altogether, and move instead, like in Rust;
2, control aliasing, like in Pony;

= type system
types show us what we can do with the data, ie which operations are valid;

the class hierarchy design, eg in Java, is problematic;
  "http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/020163371x/items/item33.html"
also the problem of covariance for generic types, has its root in this problem;
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_(Java)"
i think this problem is also the motivation for dynamic typing (another bad design);
the right way as done in Rust and Pony:
, concrete types (like final classes in Java) can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes;
, abstract types (like abstract classes in Java) cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes;

= machine learning
actors can contain parameters which can be adjusted gradually, based on received messages;
  this can be used to implement learning capabilities;
