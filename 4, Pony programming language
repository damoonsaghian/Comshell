the problem with concurrency is sharing mutable data;
ie having a mutable reference to some data, while it is shared using other references,
to prevent sharing mutable data, we can:
, abandon mutability like in Haskell; but since mutability is needed in some cases (IO),
  a complicated mechanism (Monads) is implemented to do that;
, abandon aliasing like in Rust, and copy, move, or borrow instead;
  actually this also allows Rust to eliminate the need for garbage collection;
  but since aliasing is needed in some cases (asynchronous calls),
    we have to reintroduce aliasing again, and adding more complexities;

the absence of garbage collection in Rust may seem interesting at first;
but in fact those situations which can be borrow checked statically,
  without the need for complicated lifetimes,
  can be detected by the compiler without concerning the programmer;
Rust has other complexities too, like str/String;
but one serious problem in the design of Rust is that in Rust we can't have field mutability;
  ie in Rust we can't reassign to individual fields while the whole object is immutable;

the best approach to deal with mutable data shared concurrently, is the one used in Pony;
it doesn't abandon aliasing nor mutability;
instead it controls them using reference capabilities:
, share only immutable date;
, exchange only isolated data;
Pony is a really well designed programming language;

the first column allows mutability, cause other actors can't write;
the second column needs immutability, cause other actors can read;
the last column is opaque (no read/write is allowed), cause other actors can read or write;

actors can contain parameters which can be adjusted gradually, based on received messages;
  this can be used to implement learning capabilities;
