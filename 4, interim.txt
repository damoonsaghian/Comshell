as a temporary solution something like Comshell can already be arranged using:
, Debian Linux
, i3 windows manager (xdotool, i3-msg)
, SpaceFM file manager
, text editor (Emacs or Vim)
, web browser
, media player

use btrfs, because journaling file systems can only protect metadata at an acceptable performance, since they need to write all file system operations twice, once to the journal, and once to the file system.
copy'on'write provides consistency for both data and metadata.
also, it can offer integrity of data and metadata (using checksums), at an acceptable overhead.
in addition, c'o'w also supports the creation of cheap snapshots and clones (because it does not overwrite data in place). users can take fast online backups without the need to use any special software technique like l'v'm.

automatic login:
  systemctl edit getty@tty1
    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I $TERM
exit; reboot

go to Comshell/cargo dir and:
  cargo build --release
  sudo cp .cache/release/comshell /comshell/comshell
  cp -R ../.data /comshell/
add this line to "~/.profile":
  /comshell/comshell

Comshell looks for projects in "~/projects/" and "/projects/".
a shared project directory can be created like this:
  mkdir /projects; chmod a+w /projects
