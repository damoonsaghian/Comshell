actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. first we must implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
but as a temporary solution, we can use existing tools to demonstrate what Comshell would look like.

= Arch Linux
Arch Linux provides a binary/shared library distribution system (Pacman and AUR) which is very close to the original build process.

boot to an existing Arch Linux (installed or live) then:
$ timedatectl set-ntp true
prepare the disk (use lsblk to identify the block devices), and mount it:
  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdx
  $ mount /dev/sdx /mnt
$ pacstrap /mnt grub sed intel-ucode linux systemd-sysvcompat btrfs-progs dhcpcd pacman nano man-db logrotate sway ttf-fira-mono emacs gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly midori rustup
$ arch-chroot /mnt
bootloader:
  $ grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx
  $ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
$ systemctl enable dhcpcd.service; timedatectl set-ntp true
$ exit; reboot

btrfs is used because journaling file systems can only protect metadata at an acceptable performance, since they need to write all file system operations twice, once to the journal, and once to the file system.
copy'on'write provides consistency for both data and metadata.
also, it can offer integrity of data and metadata (using checksums), at an acceptable overhead.
in addition, c'o'w also supports the creation of cheap snapshots and clones (because it does not overwrite data in place). users can take fast online backups without the need to use any special software technique like l'v'm.

$ systemctl edit getty@tty1
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I $TERM
$ nano ~/.profile
sway
$ nano ~/.config/sway/config
default_border none
default_floating_border pixel 2
exec nvim; sway exit
