actually, implementing Comshell is a lot of work. we must first implement Frem language, then a graphics library, then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
fortunately there are already great command based tools in Linux. we can use them to make a demonstration of what Comshell would look like.

Arch Linux
boot to an existing Arch Linux (installed or live) then:
  timedatectl set-ntp true
  prepare the disk (use lsblk to identify the block devices), and mount it:
    mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdx
    mount /dev/sdx /mnt
  pacstrap /mnt grub sed intel-ucode linux systemd-sysvcompat btrfs-progs dhcpcd pacman nano man-db logrotate ttf-dejavu sway emacs firefox rustup
  arch-chroot /mnt
  bootloader:
    grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
  systemctl enable dhcpcd.service; timedatectl set-ntp true
  exit; reboot

btrfs is used because journaling file systems can only protect metadata at an acceptable performance, since they need to write all file system operations twice, once to the journal, and once to the file system.
copy'on'write provides consistency for both data and metadata.
also, it can offer integrity of data and metadata (using checksums), at an acceptable overhead.
in addition, c'o'w also supports the creation of cheap snapshots and clones (because it does not overwrite data in place). users can take fast online backups without the need to use any special software technique like l'v'm.

systemctl edit getty@tty1
  [Service]
  ExecStart=
  ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I $TERM
nano ~/.profile
  sway
cp ./demo/sway.txt ~/.config/sway/config

Spacemacs

list projects, and open or go to them.
a panel at the left shows a tree view of the files in the project.
text files open in a text editor buffer at the right.
directories with ".m" extention open in a file manager buffer (Image-Dired, EMMS) at the right.
in an Emacs web view buffer, we can open the same page in Firefox. Firefox windows can be dismissed and send to scrachpad. the window will be marked, so bringing it back would be easy. the marked Firefox window will be closed when the original buffer is closed.
video player (Mplayer, ffplay) will be closed uppon pause.
