= asynchronous digital circuits
in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,
  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;
but for the circuit to do its job,
  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;
one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;
  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;

disadvantages of synchronous circuits:
, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,
  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);
  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;
, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated;
, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;
, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,
  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;
although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,
 i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;

the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:
, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;
, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,
  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;
, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;
, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;
, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;

= computers
cpu, memory, peripherals,
  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;
cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;

compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,
  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;

there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,
  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;
recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;
it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,
  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);
furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;
this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors;

on X86 architecture we can have open source boot'loader, and GPU drivers,
  using Intel with Coreboot+Grub2 for example;
  "https://www.coreboot.org/GRUB2#Scanning_for_grub.cfg_on_local_hard_drives"
  though there sill will be closed source parts (Intel FSP);
but there is no easy way to get rid of Intel ME (or AMD PSP);
though there are some hacks for disabling (but not completely remove) Intel ME:

ARM architecture is closed source too, but we can have open source GPU driver (Qualcomm/Adreno),
  and Coreboot+Grub2 bootloader;
ARM TrustZone can host an open source operating system too, apparently;

open source CPU:
, RISC-V: no adequate hardware available yet;
, PowerPc: no adequate hardware available yet;
, MIPS: bad old design (relative to other alternatives, not X86),
  no suitable hardware available yet;

programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware;
instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel;
in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system);
but in that case, we have to rewrite all the required libraries, on bare metal;
anyway, having an operating system, makes developing and testing new programs much easier;

Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel;
in Linux (and other Unix based operating systems) most things appear in the file system;
i think the reason is to make it possible to do lots of things using shell scripts,
  instead of a proper programming language;
while i can understand the convenience it provides, i don't think it's good design;
