touch interface (no multi_touch, just simple touch which can be done by a stylus too);
gestures used as shortcut commands;

Debian Linux, Gnome;

projects are looked for in "~/projects/" and all directories named "projects" on all disks,
  and shown in lists side by side (files from different disks will be in separate lists);
from these lists, we can open projects (or switch to them if they are already open),
  create new projects, etc;

automatically mount storage devices when available,
  and show their "projects" directories in seperate panes;

a bar at the top shows project name,
  and at the right end, date and various status informations;

a panel at the left shows a tree view of the files in the project;
text files are opened in a text editor panel at the right;
directories with ".m" extension are opened in a panel at the right,
  showing thumbnails of the files in it;

other projects, web pages, pdf documents, etc,
  can be opened and accessed from links inside the main project;

for those with disabilities voice commands mixed with eye tracking can help;
unlike a general speech recognition process,
  voice commands are much simpler for a speech recognition engine to process,
  since it needs to match against a relatively small set of commands;
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources;
  also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit,
    that can be put in the pocket;
  this makes the headset lighter and safer;
