<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high_fan_out, timing_sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a

a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>it's a closed source, full_blown, always_running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out

data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>to prevent sharing mutable data, we can abandon mutability like in Haskell;</div><div>but since mutability is necessary any way, it introduces a complicated mechanism

<h2>6, GUI</h2><div>implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a lot of work;</div><div>existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;</div><div>thus we can't access GTK widgets (and data structures containing them), from inside actors;</div><div>solution:</div><div><a href='https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/source/fn.idle_add.html'>https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/source/fn.idle_add.html</a></div><div><a href='https://docs.rs/fragile/1.0.0/fragile/struct.Fragile.html'>https://docs.rs/fragile/1.0.0/fragile/struct.Fragile.html</a></div><div><a href='https://docs.rs/send_wrapper/0.4.0/send_wrapper/'>https://docs.rs/send_wrapper/0.4.0/send_wrapper/</a></div><div>we deal with Gobjects by wrapping them in a Gsend;</div><div>Gsend embeds a Fragile which will be created in the GTK main thread (using "idle_add"),</div><div>  and then received (and put inside the Gsend) using a channel;</div><div>Gsend.new gets a closure (instead of a Gobject value);</div><div>  the closure's return type is the type of the specific Gobject;</div><div><p></p></div><div>another problem with GTK is its lack of features;</div><div>  for example the SourceView widget lacks indent guides;</div><div>so i'm not sure, maybe it's better to implement a GUI library, based on actors, from scratch;</div><div><a href='https://github.com/kas-gui/kas'>https://github.com/kas-gui/kas</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/Julusian/rust-cef'>https://github.com/Julusian/rust-cef</a></div><div>  <a href='https://github.com/jamethy/sdl2-cef'>https://github.com/jamethy/sdl2-cef</a></div><div>  <a href='https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython'>https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython</a></div><div>FFMPEG</div><div><p></p></div><div>;sh</div><div>curl --proto '=https' -sSf -o comshell.zip https://github.com/damoonsaghian/Comshell/archive/master.zip</div><div>unzip comshell.zip -d Comshell</div><div>cd Comshell</div><div><p></p></div><div>cargo build --release</div><div>pkexec cp .cache/target/release/comshell /usr/local/bin/</div><div><p></p></div><div>printf '[Desktop Entry]\nName=Comshell\nExec=comshell\nIcon=computer\nType=Application' &gt;</div><div>  ~/.config/autostart/comshell.desktop</div><div>pkexec cp ~/.config/autostart/comshell.desktop /etc/skel/.config/autostart/</div><div>pkexec cp ~/.config/autostart/comshell.desktop /usr/local/share/applications/</div><div>;</div>
