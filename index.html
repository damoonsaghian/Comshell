<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high_fan_out, timing_sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>it's a closed source, full_blown, always_running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors;</div><div><a

machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel;</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system);</div><div>but in that case, we have to rewrite all the required libraries, on bare metal;</div><div>anyway, having an operating system, makes developing and testing new programs much easier;</div><div><p></p></div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open_source kernel;</div><div>in Linux (and other Unix based operating systems) most things appear in the file system;</div><div>i think the reason is to make it possible to do lots of things using shell scripts,</div><div>  instead of a proper programming language;</div><div>while i can understand the convenience it provides, i don't think it's good design;</div>
<h2>3, ArchLinux</h2><div>using Arch Linux we can easily setup and maintain a Linux system;</div><div>the following shows how to setup a basic graphical environment;</div><div><p></p></div><div>boot the Arch Linux live environment;</div><div>if you need to connect to a WIFI network:</div><div>; iwctl</div><div>  device list</div><div>  station &lt;device&gt; get-networks</div><div>  station &lt;device&gt; connect &lt;SSID&gt;</div><div><p></p></div><div>; curl https://damoonsaghian/Comshell/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz</div><div>; cd Comshell/ArchLinux</div><div>ensure that the files aren't malicious;</div><div><p></p></div><div>find the device you want to install ArchLinux on with "lsblk";</div><div>note that the content of the device you want to install ArchLinux on, will be deleted;</div><div>then run this (replace "sdx" with your chosen device):</div><div>; sh install.sh sdx</div><div><p></p></div><div><img src='gnome-shell.png' alt='gnome-shell.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>in the installed system, you can press "alt-space" to show the list of applications;</div><div>a terminal emulator is installed by default;</div><div>here you can power off, reboot, logout, suspend, or lock the system,</div><div>  from the applications list, just by typing those commands;</div><div>press "alt-esc" to close the focused window;</div><div>press "alt-tab" to switch between applications;</div><div>press "alt-a" or "alt-`" to switch between the windows of an application;</div><div>press "alt-shift-space" to toggle maximized state;</div><div><p></p></div><div>additional applications can be installed using "arc add package_name";</div><div>"arc" uses "pacman" and BTRFS snapshots to manage packages in such a way that</div><div>  changes to "/usr" and "/boot" would be atomic, and does not interfere with the running system;</div><div>as a result when you install an application, or update the system using "arc",</div><div>  the system must be restarted for it to take effect;</div><div>removing packages is done live though (otherwise managing "/etc" would be complicated);</div><div>all of this means that we can have reliable automatic updates;</div><div><p></p></div><div>to connect to a WIFI network:</div><div>; nmcli dev wifi</div><div>; nmcli --ask dev wifi con &lt;ssid&gt;</div><div>to disconnect from a WIFI network:</div><div>; nmcli con down id &lt;ssid&gt;</div><div><p></p></div><div>you can set "user1" for automatic login:</div><div>; pkexec nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf</div><div>  [daemon]</div><div>  AutomaticLoginEnable=True</div><div>  AutomaticLogin=user1</div><div>but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,</div><div>  and lock the session when you leave the computer;</div><div>in addition you have to:</div><div>, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;</div><div>, protect boot firmware by a password;</div><div>  which also prevents others to select another device (eg a usb drive) to boot;</div><div>these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep in mind that</div><div>  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;</div><div><p></p></div><div>if your combined headset jack is not detected correctly, you can try this:</div><div>; pkexec echo 'options snd_hda_intel index=0 model=dell-headset-multi' &gt; /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</div><div><a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Correctly_detect_microphone_plugged_in_a_4-pin_3.5mm_(TRRS)_jack'>https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Correctly_detect_microphone_plugged_in_a_4-pin_3.5mm_(TRRS)_jack</a></div><div>this made the microphone available, but with a very bad static noise;</div><div>so maybe it's better to use a USB/Bluetooth sound card;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>system administration</b></div><div>in system administration we must ensure that:</div><div>1, the command executed is explicitly given by the user;</div><div>2, even if a program steals the root password, it still can't change the system;</div><div><p></p></div><div>"sudo" fails in both cases;</div><div><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/'>https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>"pkexec" is safer, but since the Polkit agent doesn't show command arguments, it can be vulnerable too;</div><div>further more, "pkexec" fails in the second case;</div><div>  a fake Polkit agent can be used to send the stolen password to Polkit;</div><div>and since Polkit admin is installed and active by default,</div><div>  we have to disable it to protect the system (after we have a secure alternative):</div><div>; mkdir -p /etc/polkit-1/rules.d</div><div>; echo 'polkit.addAdminRule(function(action, subject) { return []; });' &gt;</div><div>  /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-rootpw_global.rules</div><div><p></p></div><div>"su" fails in the second case too;</div><div>so we have to disable root login (after we have a secure alternative):</div><div>; passwd -l root</div><div><p></p></div><div>the solution is a program which opens a Wayland window with a command prompt;</div><div>if you have given your command as arguments to the program,</div><div>  the prompt shows that command, as default input;</div><div>after pressing "return", it asks for root password;</div>
<h2>4, Rust</h2><div>Rust makes bad programming hard, and good programming fun;</div><div>Rust does not hide inherent complexity, in fact it bolds it, so we can see it, and avoid it;</div><div>by inherent complexity i mean a complexity which can not be abstracted away completely;</div><div>  ie if we try to hide it, it will re_emerge somewhere else;</div><div>in fact, hiding inherent complexity usually leads to choosing the wrong approach;</div><div><p></p></div><div>sharing mutable data,</div><div>  ie having a mutable reference to some data, while it is shared using other references,</div><div>  is the root of many inherent complexities;</div><div><a

problem in concurrent programming is sharing mutable data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>a data race happens when these three behaviors occur:</div><div>, two or more pointers access the same data at the same time;</div><div>, at least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data;</div><div>, thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>to prevent sharing mutable data, we can abandon mutability like in Haskell;</div><div>but since mutability is necessary any way, it introduces a complicated mechanism (Monads);</div><div><p></p></div><div>another approach to deal with concurrently shared mutable data, is the one used in Pony;</div><div><a href='https://www.ponylang.io/'>https://www.ponylang.io/</a></div><div>it doesn't abandon aliasing nor mutability,</div><div>  instead it controls them using reference capabilities;</div><div>Pony's approach introduces many complexities, especially when dealing with generics;</div><div><p></p></div><div>a better approach is done by Rust, a language which overall has a better design too;</div><div>this approach even allows Rust to limit reference counting,</div><div>  to situations where it's absolutely necessary;</div><div>Pony_like actors can be done in Rust using "may_actor";</div><div><a href='https://crates.io/crates/may_actor'>https://crates.io/crates/may_actor</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>, immutable data will be wrapped in "Arc", and we have direct access to it;</div><div>, mutable data will be wrapped in "Actor" and we can access it only through the actor itself;</div><div><p></p></div><div>async access: Rc</div><div>async access from multiple threads: Arc</div><div>async mutable access: Rc&lt;RefCell&gt;</div><div>async mutable access from mutiple threads: Actor</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's better to use "&mut" only for the receiver in methods;</div><div>and anywhere else use actors to control mutability;</div><div><p></p></div><div>static data (functions, structs, constants): no problem, copy or share by reference;</div><div>dynamic data:</div><div>, if data is small we usually put it on stack;</div><div>  so we don't share it across the program, we copy it;</div><div>, if data is big we put it on heap and make references to it;</div><div>  if data is immutable we just have to manage its lifetime,</div><div>    either statically (using "&"), or dynamically (using "Arc")</div><div>  but if data is mutable we have to check if the read_write_lock pattern is fulfilled,</div><div>    using "&mut" or "Actor";</div><div>  "Mutex" or "RwLock" check read_write_lock pattern at runtime,</div><div>    and make the program to panic, if it's failed;</div><div><p></p></div><div>in Rust any resource have exactly one owner which takes care of its resource deallocation;</div><div>owners can share their data by lending them to references;</div><div>references must have a lifetime less than the owner;</div><div>furthermore lifetime of a mutable reference must not overlap with other references;</div><div><a

mutate the resource;</div><div>, mutably lend resource to another reference;</div><div>, hand over ownership (move), or deallocate resource;</div><div>and during a mutable lend, owner can't even access the resource;</div><div><p></p></div><div>immutable (and thus sharable) references can:</div><div>, access borrowed resource;</div><div>, immutably lend resource to other references;</div><div>mutable (and thus exclusive) reference can:</div><div>, access and mutate resource;</div><div>, mutably lend resource to another reference;</div><div>, immutably lend resource, but during this lending, they can't mutate it;</div><div>  just like when an owner immutably lends its resource;</div><div><p></p></div><div>during shared borrow (immutable borrow) no one owns the data;</div><div>  so even the original owner can't change it;</div><div>during mutable borrow the (unique) borrower owns it;</div><div>so "&mut" is actually a temporary transfer of ownership;</div><div><p></p></div><div>s: String -&gt; &s: &String -&gt; &s[..]: &str</div><div>v: Vec&lt;T&gt; -&gt; &v: &Vec&lt;T&gt; -&gt; &v[..]: &[T]</div><div>&str and &[T] are slices; str and [T] are unsized types;</div><div>slicing is like borrowing from an unsized type;</div><div>since the slice contains the size, the lending type itself doesn't need to have a definite size;</div><div><p></p></div><div>x = a[i] -&gt; this is possible if the elements of "a" are copy</div><div>  (cause moving out of collections is not possible);</div><div>x = &a[i] -&gt; this is for

also the motivation for dynamic typing (another bad design);</div><div>the right way as done in Pony and Rust:</div><div>, concrete types (like final classes in Java) can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes;</div><div>, abstract types (like abstract classes in Java) cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes;</div><div><p></p></div><div>note that "x.m()" is method call syntax, which completely differs from "(x.m)()";</div><div><p></p></div><div>an absolute path starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal "crate";</div><div>a relative path starts from the current module and uses</div><div>  "self", "super", or the name of an item in the current module;</div><div>if an in_scope item has the same name as a crate, then we have to resolve the ambiguity:</div><div>, using a leading "::" for a crate name;</div><div>, using a leading "self::" for an in_scope item;</div><div><p></p></div><div>arrays like tuples have fixed size and thus stored on stack;</div><div>but since they are homogeneous (all elements are of the same type),</div><div>  they can be indexed at runtime;</div><div>vectors and hash tables are homogeneous, varying sized collections;</div><div><p></p></div><div>Rust does not have named arguments and named tuples; and it's a good thing;</div><div>when you need functions with lots of arguments, or tuples with lots of elements,</div><div>  it's a sign that you need to restructure your code, and use structs to define new types;</div><div><p></p></div><div>a closure is like an anonymous struct made of variables captured from environment,</div><div>  that is callable (implements Fn/FnMut/FnOnce trait);</div><div>so all closures are unique types, but they have traits in common;</div><div>note that if we put a generic type parameter in the return type of a function,</div><div>  we have to provide the concrete type when we call the function;</div><div>  thus we can't use generic type parameters to return a

<h2>6, graphics</h2><div>software rendering gives us a lot more flexibility,</div><div>  because we won't be limited by a hardware implementation,</div><div>  with triangle only rasterization, isolated shader programs, and fixed size buffers;</div><div>GPU equivalent performance can be achieved using SIMD (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD</a>);</div><div><p></p></div><div>graphical objects are made of primitives;</div><div>  each primitive has a specific algorithm for rasterization;</div><div>2d primitives: point, line, curve, triangle, curved area;</div><div>3d objects made of flat surfaces will be broken up into triangles;</div><div>3d objects made of curved surfaces can be broken up into a number of primitive 3d surfaces,</div><div>  which can be easily projected to 2d;</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric</a></div><div>also interpolation is a good method for amorphous surfaces;</div><div><p></p></div><div>2d objects will be rasterized into pixels (a pixel is a coordinate plus a color value);</div><div>then these rasterized objects will be drawn in the framebuffer,</div><div>  in layers over each other (in an overlay on top of all 3d objects);</div><div>rasterizing 3d objects, produces an array of fragments;</div><div>  a fragment, besides color, contains a normal and a depth;</div><div>when creating the pixels of the framebuffer from the fragments,</div><div>  the normals are used for lighting, and the depths are used for z_buffer;</div><div><p></p></div><div>graphical objects are of 2 kinds:</div><div>, those which we know will remain unchanged the next time we want to draw to the framebuffer;</div><div>  these objects are first rasterized into memory, then we copy it into framebuffer;</div><div>, those which we know will be changed (scaled, rotated, moved in z direction)</div><div>  the next time we want to draw to the framebuffer</div><div>    (which happens a lot for animations with high frame rate);</div><div>  these objects will be drawn directly to the framebuffer;</div><div>(framebuffer uses double buffering and v_sync;)</div><div>note that if an object just moves in x_y plane (without rotation),</div><div>  the cached rasterization is still useful;</div><div>  for 2d objects we simply add a constant to the position of all pixels;</div><div>  for 3d objects we may additionally want to recompute the lighting of pixels from fragments;</div><div><p></p></div><div>data structure for graphical objects:</div><div>, primitives</div><div>, material</div><div>, cached rasterization (can
