<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high-fan-out, timing-sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>it's a closed source, full-blown, always-running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors;</div><div><a

adequate hardware available yet;</div><div>, PowerPc: no adequate hardware available yet;</div><div>, MIPS: bad old design (relative to other alternatives, not X86),</div><div>  no suitable hardware available yet;</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware;</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel;</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system);</div><div>but in that case, we have to rewrite all the required libraries, on bare metal;</div><div>anyway, having an operating system, makes developing and testing new programs much easier;</div><div><p></p></div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open-source kernel;</div><div>in Linux (and other Unix based operating systems) most things appear in the file system;</div><div>i think the reason is to make it possible to do lots of things using shell scripts,</div><div>  instead of a proper programming language;</div><div>while i can understand the convenience it provides, i don't think it's good design;</div>
