<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high-fan-out, timing-sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>it's a closed source, full_blown, always_running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors;</div><div><a

available yet;</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware;</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the

<h2>4, Pony programming language</h2><div>the problem with concurrency is sharing mutable data;</div><div>ie having a mutable reference to some data, while it is shared using other references,</div><div>to prevent sharing mutable data, we can:</div><div>, abandon mutability like in Haskell; but since mutability is necessary in some cases,</div><div>  a complicated mechanism (Monads) is implemented;</div><div>, abandon aliasing like in Rust, and copy, move, or borrow instead;</div><div>  actually this also allows Rust to eliminate the need for garbage collection;</div><div>  but since aliasing is needed in some cases (asynchronous calls),</div><div>    we have to reintroduce aliasing again, adding more complexities;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the absence of garbage collection in Rust may seem interesting at first;</div><div>but in fact those situations which can be borrow checked statically,</div><div>  without the need for complicated lifetimes,</div><div>  can be detected by the compiler without concerning the programmer;</div><div>Rust has other complexities too, like str/String;</div><div>but one serious problem in the design of Rust is that in Rust we can't have field mutability;</div><div>  ie in Rust we can't reassign to individual fields when the variable is not reassignable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the best approach to deal with mutable data shared concurrently, is the one used in Pony;</div><div>it doesn't abandon aliasing nor mutability;</div><div>instead it controls them using reference capabilities;</div><div>Pony is a really well designed programming language: <a href='https://www.ponylang.io/'>https://www.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>type signature in Pony: TypeName capability ephemerality</div><div><p></p></div><div>                  |        RW         |          R        |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: ...  |        iso        |         ...       |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: R    |        trn        |         val       |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: RW   |        ref        |         box       |        tag        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>                  | global alias: ... |  global alias: R  | global alias: RW  |</div><div><p></p></div><div>the first column allows mutability, cause other actors can't write;</div><div>the second column needs immutability, cause other actors can read;</div><div>the last column is opaque (no read/write is allowed), cause other actors can read or write;</div><div><p></p></div><div>improvements for Pony language:</div><div>, remove the need for "where" in named arguments;</div><div>, remove the need to write the primes in arg names, when calling a constructor;</div><div>, named tuples: (a = x, b = y)</div><div>, hash tables: ["a", x; "b", y] or [a = x; b = y]</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://tutorial.ponylang.io/'>https://tutorial.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/tree/master/examples'>https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/tree/master/examples</a></div><div><a href='https://stdlib.ponylang.io/'>https://stdlib.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable'>https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>wit Pony we can get rid of a global event loop;</div><div><p></p></div><div>actors can contain parameters which can be adjusted gradually, based on received messages;</div><div>  this can be used to implement learning capabilities;</div>
