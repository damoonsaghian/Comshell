<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high_fan_out, timing_sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>it's a closed source, full_blown, always_running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out

data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>to prevent sharing mutable data, we can abandon mutability like in Haskell;</div><div>but since mutability is necessary any way, it introduces a complicated mechanism
