<h2>1, command based user interface</h2><div>command based user interfaces (keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster more convenient and more powerful than pointing based user interfaces (mouse, touch, pen).</div><div>pointing interfaces can be useful only for very simple tasks. also for some special artistic applications pen input remains the only choice.</div><div><p></p></div><div><img src='keyboard.png' alt='keyboard.png'/></div><div>, two commas --&gt; .</div><div>, comma followed by ' --&gt; "</div><div>, comma followed by ( --&gt; [</div><div>, comma followed by add followed by comma --&gt; +</div><div>, comma followed by add followed by space --&gt; + followed by space</div><div>, comma followed by psi followed by space --&gt; Ïˆ</div><div>, two apostrophies followed by a --&gt; A</div><div><p></p></div><div>Vim'like key'bindings</div><div>modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive.</div><div>pressing "esc" key always take you back to normal mode.</div><div>in normal mode we can:</div><div>, create a new project or chapter</div><div>, show projects or chapter, move between them (previous, next), and then press space to open or raise them, or directly go to them by entering their number</div><div>, move the cursor to the next or previous (or by entering the number directly to) words, lines (or table cells), paragraphs, pages</div><div>, start and end selection, then copy or cut</div><div>, paste</div><div>, undo, redo</div><div>, find</div><div>, enter insert mode</div><div><p></p></div><div>command based interactions are much simpler for a speech recognition engine to process, since it needs to match against a relatively small set of commands, unlike a general speech to text process.</div><div>a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources. also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit, that can be put in the pocket. this makes the headset lighter and safer.</div><div>for those that neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based interface can be implemented.</div><div><p></p></div><div>Comshell, command based user interface, created using Rust ecosystem.</div>
