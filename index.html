<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary invalid values, until they stabilize to the valid values;</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job,</div><div>  gates with memory (registers) must operate only when the inputs have correct values;</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>, distributing a high-fan-out, timing-sensitive clock signal can be complicated;</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics;</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div> i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not;</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate;</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs;</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated;</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language;</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source;</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse;</div><div>since for implementing it some vendors, like Intel and AMD,</div><div>  expand their closed source firmware, to a full_blown always_running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network);</div><div>furthermore they make it practically impossible for users to disable it;</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors;</div><div><a

alternatives:</div><div>RISC-V: no appropriate hardware available yet;</div><div>PowerPc: no appropriate hardware available yet;</div><div>MIPS: bad old design (relative to other alternatives, not X86),</div><div>  no appropriate hardware available yet;</div><div>ARM: closed source, but with much better design than X86,</div><div>  and can have open source firmware (like EDK2 which is an open source UEFI implementation),</div><div>  but so far i couldn't find an appropriate hardware;</div><div>  a decent hardware based on Qualcomm/Adreno would be pretty good;</div><div>an ideal system would have powerful enough CPU, and a GPU with open source driver,</div><div>  8GB DDR4, and EDK2 boot firmware;</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware;</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel;</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system);</div><div>but in that case, we have to rewrite all the required libraries, on bare metal;</div><div>anyway, having an operating system, makes developing and testing new programs much easier;</div><div><p></p></div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open_source kernel;</div><div>in Linux (and other Unix based operating systems) most things appear in the file system;</div><div>i think the reason is to make it possible to do lots of things using shell scripts,</div><div>  instead of a proper programming language;</div><div>while i can understand the convenience it provides, i don't think it's good design;</div>
<h2>3, Arch Linux</h2><div>Arch Linux helps us to setup and maintain a Linux system;</div><div>first boot to an existing Arch Linux, which can be the live image,</div><div>  or an already installed one, with "arch-install-scripts" package installed,</div><div>  and a root terminal (just call "su" in a normal user's terminal);</div><div><p></p></div><div>to ensure the system clock is accurate:</div><div>; timedatectl set-ntp true</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need 2 partitions:</div><div>, +550M EFI system partition (partition type code: 1)</div><div>, and the rest for Linux system partition (the default partition type)</div><div>list disks using "fdisk -l", then use "fdisk /dev/sdx" to create the partitions:</div><div>, enter "g" command to create a GPT partition table;</div><div>, enter "n" to add a new partition;</div><div>, enter "t" to set the partition type</div><div>, enter "w" to write and exit;</div><div>format the partitions:</div><div>; mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdx1; mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx2</div><div><p></p></div><div>; mount /dev/sdx2 /mnt</div><div>; mkdir /mnt/boot; mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot</div><div>; mkdir /mnt/etc; genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab</div><div><p></p></div><div>now you can even reuse packages previously downloaded on current system,</div><div>  by copying them to "/mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg";</div><div>; pacstrap /mnt pacman</div><div><p></p></div><div>; arch-chroot /mnt</div><div>; pacman -S linux-lts systemd-sysvcompat intel-ucode \</div><div>  networkmanager pulseaudio-alsa udisks2 logrotate man-db nano unzip pony-stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>install "systemd-boot" bootloader:</div><div>; sh systemd-boot.sh /dev/sdx2</div><div><p></p></div><div>; useradd -m -G wheel user1</div><div>; passwd user1</div><div>; passwd</div><div><p></p></div><div>; echo -e "\n\nen_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen</div><div>; locale-gen</div><div>; echo -e "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" &gt; /etc/locale.conf</div><div><p></p></div><div>; systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service</div><div>; systemctl enable NetworkManager.service</div><div>; exit</div><div>; reboot</div><div><p></p></div><div>some audio devices can send and_or receive volume control signals;</div><div>  PulseAudio mutes and silences these device, by default;</div><div>so if you like you can do this:</div><div>; pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ 0</div><div>; pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ 100%</div>
<h2>4, Pony programming language</h2><div>the problem with concurrency is sharing mutable data;</div><div>ie having a mutable reference to some data, while it is shared using other references,</div><div>to prevent sharing mutable data, we can:</div><div>, abandon mutability like in Haskell; but since mutability is needed in some cases (IO),</div><div>  a complicated mechanism (Monads) is implemented to do that;</div><div>, abandon aliasing like in Rust, and copy, move, or borrow instead;</div><div>  actually this also allows Rust to eliminate the need for garbage collection;</div><div>  but since aliasing is needed in some cases (asynchronous calls),</div><div>    we have to reintroduce aliasing again, and adding more complexities;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the absence of garbage collection in Rust may seem interesting at first;</div><div>but in fact those situations which can be borrow checked statically,</div><div>  without the need for complicated lifetimes,</div><div>  can be detected by the compiler without concerning the programmer;</div><div>Rust has other complexities too, like str/String;</div><div>but one serious problem in the design of Rust is that in Rust we can't have field mutability;</div><div>  ie in Rust we can't reassign to individual fields while the whole object is immutable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>the best approach to deal with mutable data shared concurrently, is the one used in Pony;</div><div>it doesn't abandon aliasing nor mutability;</div><div>instead it controls them using reference capabilities:</div><div>, share only immutable date;</div><div>, exchange only isolated data;</div><div>Pony is a really well designed programming language;</div><div><a href='https://www.ponylang.io/'>https://www.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>type in Pony: TypeName capability ephemeral</div><div><p></p></div><div>                  |        RW         |          R        |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: ...  |        iso        |         ...       |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: R    |        trn        |         val       |        ...        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>local alias: RW   |        ref        |         box       |        tag        |</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>                  | global alias: ... |  global alias: R  | global alias: RW  |</div><div><p></p></div><div>the first column allows mutability, cause other actors can't write;</div><div>the second column needs immutability, cause other actors can read;</div><div>the last column is opaque (no read/write is allowed), cause other actors can read or write;</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://tutorial.ponylang.io/'>https://tutorial.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/tree/master/examples'>https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/tree/master/examples</a></div><div><a href='https://stdlib.ponylang.io/'>https://stdlib.ponylang.io/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable'>https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>actors can contain parameters which can be adjusted gradually, based on received messages;</div><div>  this can be used to implement learning capabilities;</div>
