<h2>1, computers</h2><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change,</div><div>  the outputs can have temporary incorrect values,</div><div>    until they stabilize to correct values;</div><div>  so gates with memory, must be synchronized with a global clock signal;</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable;</div><div>this forces us to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining);</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient;</div><div>in addition the widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power,</div><div>  and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not;</div><div>the solution is to use rendezvous channels,</div><div>  in which sends and receives are blockd until the other side is ready;</div><div>initially all channels have default values (this is necessary to cope with feedbacks);</div><div>  then gates start to fetch their inputs from channels and compute their output values;</div><div>  and when their following gates are ready to receive it,</div><div>    they send it to the output channels;</div><div>  now the gate itself is ready to receive new values on its inputs;</div><div><p></p></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals,</div><div>  this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers;</div><div>  though universal memory technologies (like magneto_resistive random_access memory)</div><div>    if possible, could make things simpler;</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations called instructions (packages of 0 and 1),</div><div>  one by one;</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on a computer hardware;</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called kernel;</div><div>Linux is a highly developted, constantly evolving, open_source kernel;</div><div>in Linux (and other Unix based operating systems) most things appear in the file system;</div><div>  i think the reason is to make it possible to do a lot of things using shell scripts</div><div>    instead of a proper programming language;</div><div>  while i can understand the convenience it provides, i think it's bad design;</div><div><a href='https://github.com/thepowersgang/rust_os'>https://github.com/thepowersgang/rust_os</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/ryanra/RustOS'>https://github.com/ryanra/RustOS</a></div><div><a href='https://dominuscarnufex.github.io/cours/rs-kernel/en.html'>https://dominuscarnufex.github.io/cours/rs-kernel/en.html</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that obtain computer instructions</div><div>  from a program written in a language which is human readable and structured;</div><div>  in this way, the written program will be portable to different computer architectures;</div><div>Rust is a programming language which provides zero cost abstractions</div><div>  (eg a well designed type system, and functional programming techniques),</div><div>  and memory safety without garbage collection;</div><div>  thus there is absolutely no reason to write new software in C/C++;</div>
<h2>2, Rust</h2><div>Rust makes bad programming hard, and good programming fun;</div><div>Rust does not hide complexity, in fact it bolds it, so we can see it, and avoid it;</div><div><p></p></div><div>evolution of C language:</div><div>, wrong approach:</div><div>  classes (C++)</div><div>  garbage collection:</div><div>    , classes (Java, C#, ...)</div><div>    , immutable data (Haskell)</div><div>, right approach: traits, move semantics (Rust)</div><div><p></p></div><div>shared mutability is the root of many complexities,</div><div>  especially in concurrent environments;</div><div>all references in Rust must either be unique or immutable;</div><div><p></p></div><div>any resource have exactly one owner which takes care of its resource deallocation;</div><div><a href='http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/'>http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/</a></div><div>owners can share their data by lending them to references;</div><div>  references must have a lifetime less than the owner;</div><div><p></p></div><div>owner can:</div><div>, control resource deallocation</div><div>, lend the resource:</div><div>  , immutably (multiple refs)</div><div>  , mutably (only on ref)</div><div>, hand over ownership (move)</div><div>owner can't:</div><div>, during borrow:</div><div>  , mutate the resource</div><div>  , mutably lend the resource</div><div>, during mutable borrow:</div><div>  , access the resource</div><div>  , lend the resource</div><div><p></p></div><div>reference can:</div><div>, access borrowed resource</div><div>, share (copy) an immutable borrow</div><div>mutable reference can:</div><div>, access and mutate resource</div><div>, hand over (move) the mutable borrow (mutable ref is moved by default)</div><div><p></p></div><div>life_time of argument references ends after function call; so we can have this:</div><div>  f(&mut a);</div><div>  g(&mut a);</div><div><p></p></div><div>scenarios that involve multiple refs or returning refs often require explicit lifetimes;</div><div>  so don't return refs, instead use mutable refs in inputs;</div><div>structs and enums containing refs must have explicit lifetimes;</div><div>  impl of these must use lifetimes too;</div><div>  so don't use them;</div><div><p></p></div><div>Rust have separate types for static and dynamic values; (str/String, fn/Fn)</div><div>functions can only access static environment;</div><div>  closures don't have this limitation; so when using them we must be more careful;</div><div>static data can be defined using only other static data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>arrays have a fixed size, so they can be implemented on stack;</div><div>  but they are mutable, so unlike "str" they can't be static;</div><div><p></p></div><div>automatic referencing in method calls (auto_borrow for self);</div><div><p></p></div><div>Rust auto_dereferences variables when:</div><div>, making method calls on a reference</div><div>, passing a ref as a function argument</div><div>  (because the type signature for functions are mandatory)</div><div>you have to deref vars when:</div><div>, assigning to them without type annotation</div><div>, using overloaded operators</div><div><p></p></div><div>if x doesn't implement foo() but implements Deref then:</div><div>  x.foo() --&gt; x.deref().foo()</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>type system</b></div><div>types show us what we can do with the data (which operations are valid);</div><div><p></p></div><div>the class hierarchy design like in Java is problematic;</div><div>  <a href='http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/020163371x/items/item33.html'>http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/020163371x/items/item33.html</a></div><div>also the problem of covariance for generic types, has its root in this problem;</div><div>  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_(Java)'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_(Java)</a></div><div>i think this is also the reason that</div><div>  some prefer dynamic typing (another bad design) over static typing;</div><div>the right way is to use structs and traits (like in Rust and Go):</div><div>, structs are like final classes in Java, we use them to make object,</div><div>  but we can't inherit other classes from them;</div><div>, traits are like abstract classes in Java, we can inherit other classes from them,</div><div>  but we can't directly use them to make objects;</div><div>this way, all non_leaf classes will be abstract (traits),</div><div>  and all leaf classes will be final (structs);</div><div><p></p></div><div>tuples (heterogeneous, fixed size collection):</div><div>x = (1, "aaa")</div><div>named tuple: {i: 1, j: "aaa"}</div><div>access:</div><div>, destructuring</div><div>  let (a, b) = (1, "aaa")</div><div>, dot notation</div><div>  tuples: x.0 (literal number only)</div><div>  named tuples: x.i</div><div><p></p></div><div>arrays (homogeneous, fixed sized collection):</div><div>  indexing can be done at runtime because all elements have the same type;</div><div>vectors and hash tables (homogeneous, varying sized collection)</div><div><p></p></div><div>dot notation is used where we can destucture (tuples, structures);</div><div>double colon "::" is for namespacing;</div>
<h2>3, functional reactive programming</h2><div>imperative programming is done by procedurally changing stored values,</div><div>  it resembles the way CPU runs the instructions stored in memory;</div><div>imperative programming leads to unmaintainable code in large programs,</div><div>  and it makes writing parallel programs a cumbersome task;</div><div><p></p></div><div>functional reactive programming:</div><div>when the output channels of a function is empty and the input channels are full,</div><div>  the function consumes its inputs and fills its outputs with computed values;</div><div>initially all channels have default values, so feedbacks are possible;</div><div><p></p></div><div>functions just compute new data, they don't change anything outside of the function;</div><div>  but many computations need to mutate the data given to them,</div><div>    because the data is big and copying it would be inefficient;</div><div>one method as seen in languages like Haskell and Clojure is to use persistent data structures;</div><div>  in this method only the mutated part of data is computed,</div><div>    and the rest of data is accessed through a reference to the original data;</div><div>  this may introduce some efficiency costs,</div><div>    but more importantly this method needs garbage collection;</div><div>another method is to use value semantics and copy_on_write, as in Swift;</div><div>  this method introduces some run_time cost because of reference counting;</div><div>  (it's actually a run_time solution;)</div><div>the key to a real solution is move semantics (also known as uniqueness or linear types),</div><div>  as used in LinearML, Mercury and Rust;</div><div>  note that none of these languages need run_time garbage collection;</div><div><p></p></div><div>passing data across functions:</div><div>, copy (for small primitive data)</div><div>, borrow (immutable, lifetime is known at compile_time)</div><div>, counted reference (immutable, lifetime is unknown at compile_time)</div><div>, move (for linear type data, in_place mutability is possible)</div><div><p></p></div><div>, static data (like functions): no problem, share by reference</div><div>, dynamic data</div><div>  , small data: move it, or share by copying</div><div>  , big data: move (no sharing)</div><div>functional reactive programming allow us to program without the need to share big data;</div><div><p></p></div><div>keep related states in one place (to avoid copying big data);</div><div>a set of messages as input;</div><div>each kind of message changes one part of the state;</div><div><p></p></div><div>from "Henry G Baker, use_once variables and linear objects":</div><div>programming languages should have use_once variables,</div><div>  in addition to the usual multiple_use variables;</div><div>use_once variables are bound to linear (unshared, unaliased, or singly_referenced) objects;</div><div>linear objects are cheap to access and manage,</div><div>  because they require no synchronization or tracing garbage collection;</div><div>linear objects can elegantly and efficiently solve</div><div>  otherwise difficult problems of functional systems,</div><div>  eg in_place updating and the efficient initialization of functional objects;</div><div>a use_once variable must be dynamically referenced exactly once within its scope;</div><div>  unreferenced use_once variables must be explicitly killed,</div><div>  and multiply_referenced use_once variables must be explicitly copied;</div><div>  use_once variables are bound only to linear objects,</div><div>    which may reference other linear or non_linear objects;</div><div>  non_linear objects can reference other non_linear objects,</div><div>    but can reference a linear object only in a way that ensures mutual exclusion;</div><div>linear objects and use_once variables map elegantly</div><div>  into data_flow models of concurrent computation;</div><div>  and the graphical representations of data_flow models</div><div>    make an appealing visual linear programming language;</div><div>the acceptance by a function of a linear argument object,</div><div>  places a great responsibility on the function;</div><div>  the function must either pass the linear object to another function as an argument,</div><div>    explicitly dispose of it, or return it as a return value;</div><div>a linear language is ideal for a dataflow architecture,</div><div>  which must explicitly duplicate/delete (linear) tokens;</div><div><p></p></div><div>move semantics + streams:</div><div>  the right approach to functional reactive programming</div><div><p></p></div><div>in software, there is a limited number of central processing units</div><div>  (unlike in hardware where there is distinct processing units);</div><div>  so we use an event_loop and thread pool to implement functional reactive programming;</div><div><a href='https://tokio.rs/docs/going-deeper-futures/futures-mechanics/#adapters'>https://tokio.rs/docs/going-deeper-futures/futures-mechanics/#adapters</a></div><div><a
