actually, to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot from USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but not impossible;
physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;

lock extension directory of the user (for security reasons);
; mkdir /home/user1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
; touch /home/user1/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/0
; cp -r etc/gnome-shell-improved/ /usr/local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
