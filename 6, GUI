implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a huge lot of work;
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded;
so although we can access actors from GTK thread,
  we can't access GTK widgets (and structure containing them), from actors;
so GTK widgets must be wrapped as actors;
we send them messages, and they run their code in GTK main loop using "g_idle_add";
