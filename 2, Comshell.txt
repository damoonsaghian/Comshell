to install the dependencies of EFL, in Unix'like systems, use the system's package manager.
for Windows install MSYS2. then add the bin directories to the paths environment variable:
  SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\msys64\usr\local\bin;C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
   (for 32bit systems, just replace 64 with 32)
  SETX PATH %PATH%
then just compile and install EFL.
