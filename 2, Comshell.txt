Comshell is a command based user interface, being developed using Rust ecosystem.

retained'mode (scene'graph) graphics library

GTK is good for text, image, and layouts. it has good Rust bindings (even for Gstreamer and Webkit). but it doesn't provide a 3d scene'graph.
Qt has retained 2d/3d, but Rust bindings are terrible. and it seems that creating a good binding is impossible.
EFL has scene'graph based graphics from the ground up. but its image'based (as opposed to vector'based), maintenance is not very good, and there is no active Rust bindings.

Clutter seems to be a good choice. although there isn't an active Rust bindings, it seems to be easy to create one.
the scene'graph in Clutter is made up of actors. in an actor we can draw anything, using (immediate'mode) Cairo and Cogl a'p'i.

to install Clutter in Windows use MSYS2.
you must also add MSYS2 bin directory to the paths environment variable. e'g for 64 bit version:
  SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
  SETX PATH "%PATH%"
