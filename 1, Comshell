= command based user interface
command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are
  faster, more convenient and more powerful
  than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen);
touch interfaces can still be useful in simple limited applications;
also for some special artistic applications, pen input remains the only choice;
touch interface may seem very convenient at first sight,
  especially if accompanied with the power of gestures;
but the problem is the form_factor:
 since interaction at a distance is not possible, one must always carry the whole system;

detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
  because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands;
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources;
  also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit,
    that can be put in the pocket;
  this makes the headset lighter and safer;
for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk,
  gesture based (2d) input can be implemented;

= Comshell
Comshell is a unified computing environment, utilizing command based user interface;

a pannel at the left shows the list of files in the project;
  we can move between files, and copy/rename/delete/create them;
projects are directories inside "~/projects/";
list of all projects will appear in a floating layer, at the center of screen;

text files are opened in a text editor panel at the right;
directories with ".m" extension are opened in a panel at the right,
  showing thumbnails of the files in it;

non_local projects, web pages, pdf documents, etc,
  accessed from links inside the main project, and will be opened in a floating layer;
projects in external disks (inside a root directory named "projects"),
  can be accessed from a list view, and will be opened in a floating layer;

modal key_bindings;
modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive;
press "escape" to go back to normal mode;
in normal mode we can:
, move the cursor to the next or previous character or word
, move the cursor to the next or previous lines or table cells
, move the cursor to the next or previous paragraph
, start and end selection, then copy or cut
, paste
, undo, redo
, find
, enter insert mode
