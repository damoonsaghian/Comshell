command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster more convenient and more powerful than pointing based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen).
pointing interfaces can be useful only for very simple tasks. also for some special artistic applications pen input remains the only choice.

Vim'like key'bindings
modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive.
pressing "esc" key always take you back to normal mode.
in normal mode we can:
, create a new project or chapter
, show projects or chapter, move between them (previous, next), and then press space to open or raise them, or directly go to them by entering their number
, move the cursor to the next or previous (or by entering the number directly to) words, lines (or table cells), paragraphs, pages
, start and end selection, then copy or cut
, paste
, undo, redo
, find
, enter insert mode

command based interactions are much simpler for a speech recognition engine to process, since it needs to match against a relatively small set of commands, unlike a general speech to text process.
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources. also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit, that can be put in the pocket. this makes the headset lighter and safer.
for those that neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based interface can be implemented.

Comshell is a command based user interface, being developed using Rust ecosystem.
