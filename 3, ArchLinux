using Arch Linux we can easily setup and maintain a Linux system;
the following shows how to setup a basic graphical environment, using GnomeShell;
press "alt-space" to show the list of applications;
there you can also do poweroff/restart, logout, suspend, and lock, by typing them;

there is a prototype of Comshell implemented using Neovim, Gjs, Webkit2gtk and Gstreamer;
it will be launched at startup (if Comshell itself is not present);

boot Arch Linux live environment;
to ensure the system clock is accurate:
; timedatectl set-ntp true
if you need to connect to a WIFI network:
; iwctl
  device list
  station <device> get-networks
  station <device> connect <SSID>

list available block devices using "lsblk", then on the intended block device,
  create the needed partitions, and finally format and mount them:
; printf "label: gpt\n,260MiB,U,*\n;" | sfdisk /dev/<device>
; mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/<partition1>; mkfs.btrfs /dev/<partition2>
; mount /dev/<partition2> /mnt
; mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
; mount /dev/<partition1> /mnt/boot/efi
; mkdir /mnt/etc
; genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

; pacstrap /mnt base git
; arch-chroot /mnt
; git clone https://github.com/damoonsaghian/Comshell.git ./Comshell
; cd Comshell
ensure that the files in "ArchLinux" and "Comshell_proto" directories aren't malicious, then:
; sh ArchLinux/install.sh
; exit; reboot

to connect to a WIFI network:
; nmcli dev wifi
; nmcli --ask dev wifi con <ssid>
to disconnect from a WIFI network:
; nmcli con down id <ssid>

you can set "user1" for automatic login:
; pkexec nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-myconfig.conf
  autologin-user=user1
; pkexec groupadd -r autologin
; pkexec gpasswd -a user1 autologin
and remove the locker:
; rm ~/.config/autostart/light-locker.desktop
but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot from USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep in mind that
  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;

note that due to a bug, "pkexec" does not work with the fallback Polkit agent,
  which is the only one available, in Linux console (ie when GnomeShell is not running);
there is a workaround though (it requires "ctrl+c" to stop):
; pkttyagent -p $(echo $$) | pkexec ...
or you can just use "su" instead;
