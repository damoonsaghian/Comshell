using Arch Linux we can easily setup and maintain a Linux system;
the following shows how to setup a basic graphical environment,
  with Atom editor and Chromium browser, which you can toggle in between with "alt-tab";
also there is a terminal which you can show with "alt-`" and hide with "alt-tab";
in addition, we can write scripts, to open various graphical applications,
  each in its own workspace ("alt-space" brings you back to the workspace with Atom editor);

boot Arch Linux live environment;
to ensure the system clock is accurate:
; timedatectl set-ntp true
if you need to connect to a WIFI network:
; iwctl
  device list
  station <device> get-networks
  station <device> connect <SSID>

list available block devices using "lsblk", then on the intended block device,
  create the needed partitions, then format and mount them:
; printf "label: gpt\n,260MiB,U,*\n;" | sfdisk /dev/<device>
; mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/<partition1>; mkfs.btrfs /dev/<partition2>
; mount /dev/<partition2> /mnt
; mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
; mount /dev/<partition1> /mnt/boot/efi
; mkdir /mnt/etc
; genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

; pacstrap /mnt base
; arch-chroot /mnt
; curl --proto '=https' -sSf -o #1 \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoonsaghian/Comshell/master/etc/{arch-install.sh,sway}
study the downloaded files, and then:
; sh arch-install.sh
; exit; reboot

the above script sets the "user1" for automatic login;
but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer;
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware;
, disable boot from USB (and other external ports);
, protect boot firmware by a password;
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but not impossible;
keep in mind that physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources;

after booting into the installed Arch Linux, you will see a terminal window;
to connect to a WIFI network:
; nmcli dev wifi
; nmcli --ask dev wifi con <ssid>
to disconnect from a WIFI network:
; nmcli con down id <ssid>
to disable WIFI:
; nmcli radio wifi off

; sudo pacman -S xorg-server-xwayland atom chromium aria2 moc mpv

; mkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-3.0
; cp etc/gtk.css ~/.config/gtk-3.0/
; printf '[Settings]\ngtk-theme-name = Materia-light-compact\ngtk-font-name = Sans' >
  ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
; gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme Materia-light-compact
; gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name Sans

; cp etc/atom/* ~/.atom/
; mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
; cp /usr/share/applications/atom.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

in Chromium settings:
, enable "use system title bar and borders";
, enable "continue where you left off";
, disable "continue running background apps when Chromium is closed";
