Comshell is a command based user interface, being developed in Frem programing language (which is based on Rust).
"https://github.com/damoonsaghian/Frem"

command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster more convenient and more powerful than pointing based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen).
pointing interfaces can be useful only for very simple tasks. also for some special artistic applications pen input remains the only choice.
command based interactions are much simpler for a speech recognition engine to process, since it needs to match against a relatively small set of commands, unlike a general speech to text process.
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources. also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit, that can be put in the pocket. this makes the headset lighter and safer.
for those that neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based interface can be implemented.

missing characters can be entered using snippets:
, two commas --> .
, comma followed by ' --> "
, comma followed by ( --> [
, comma followed by add followed by comma --> +
, comma followed by add followed by space --> + followed by space
, comma followed by psi followed by space --> Ïˆ
, two apostrophes followed by a --> A

Vim'like key'bindings
modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive.
pressing "esc" key always take you back to normal mode.
in normal mode we can:
, create a new project or file
, show list of projects or files, move between files (previous, next), and then press space to open or raise them, or directly go to them by entering their number
, move the cursor to the next or previous (or by entering the number directly to) words, lines (or table cells), paragraphs
, start and end selection, then copy or cut
, paste
, undo, redo
, find
, enter insert mode

project manager:
, search all disks for a directory named "projects"
, projects list

file browser:
, thumbnails for images and videos
, expand directories in a tree view.
, select files by typing their names.
, when a file is opened, a new pane is created at right, showing the file in a tab.
, the active file is always visible and highlighted.
, open files in the current tab (even if it is open in another tab).
, different views of a project can be opened in separate tabs.
, external files (websites, pdf, ...) will be opened in an adjacent tab.

focus paragraph, i'e auto scroll to reveal whole paragraph.
auto fold/unfold for code.

Comshell looks for projects in "~/projects/" and "/projects/".
a shared project directory can be created like this:
  mkdir /projects; chmod a+w /projects

actually implementing Comshell is a lot of work. we must first implement Frem language, then a graphics library (as discussed in next chapter), then a lot of standard u'i utilities on top of that library.
fortunately Atom editor provides just the right tools, to quickly build a demonstration of what Comshell would look like.
