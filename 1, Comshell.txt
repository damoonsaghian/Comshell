= command based user interface
command based user interfaces (using gesture, voice, keyboard) are
  faster, more convenient and more powerful,
  than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)
pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability;
but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),
  there is no need for a pointer based user interface;

touch based interfaces can still be useful in simple or special applications;
touch interface has an additional problem:
 since interaction at a distance is not possible, one must always carry the whole system;

a muli_touch touchpad can simulate key presses on a keyboard;
it can also have a separate mode to operate as a mouse;
for keyboards we either need a lot of keys, or we have to use modal editing (like in Vim);

detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
  because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands;
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources;
also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit,
  that can be put in the pocket;
  this makes the headset lighter and safer;

= Comshell
Comshell is a unified computing environment, utilizing command based user interface;

".data/Comshell.png"

projects are directories inside "~/projects/";
list of all projects will appear in a floating layer, at the center of screen;
list of all files in the project will be displayed in a tree_view at the left;
we can have views of different locations in a project (even of the same file);

text files will be opened in a text editor;
directories with ".g" suffixes, will be opened in a gallery view;
directories with ".mp4" and ".mp3" suffixes, act like a media containers;

files and directories with names starting with a dot, will be hidden;
".cache" directory inside a project is for files we don't want to share or backup;

non_local projects, web pages, PDF documents, etc,
  accessed from links inside the main project, will be opened in a floating layer;
web pages:
, move caret between visual objects (ignoring structural objects);
, or use hinting for text input and other widgets, text and other elements like images and videos;

projects in external disks (inside a root directory named "projects"),
  can be accessed from a floating list view;

at the bottom, there is a status_bar showing messages at the left, and system status at the right;
system status: network, CPU and RAM usage, year-month-day week_day AM/PM hour:minute

gestures to:
, move the cursor to the next or previous character or word;
, move the cursor to the next or previous lines or table cells;
, move the cursor to the next or previous paragraph;
, start and end selection, then copy or cut;
, paste
, undo
, find
, auto_completion
