= command based user interface
command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are
  faster, more convenient and more powerful,
  than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)
pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability;
but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),
  there is no need for a pointer based user interface;

touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible;
but it can still be useful in simple or special applications;

detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
  because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands;
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources;
also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit,
  that can be put in the pocket;
  this makes the headset lighter and safer;

for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk,
  gesture based (2d) input can be implemented;

= Comshell
Comshell is a unified computing environment, utilizing command based user interface;

projects are directories inside "~/projects/",
  or in non_removable disks, inside a root directory named "projects";
list of all projects will appear in a floating layer, at the center of screen;
list of files in the project will be displayed in the left side_bar;
we can have views of different locations in a project (even of the same file);

projects in removable disks (inside a root directory named "projects"),
  can be accessed from the floating layer showing projects list;

text files will be opened in a text editor;
directories with ".g" suffixes, will be opened in a gallery view;
files and directories inside galleries, will be opened in a floating layer;

files and directories with names starting with a dot, will be hidden;
".cache" directory inside a project is for files we don't want to share or backup;

non_local projects, web pages, PDF documents, etc,
  accessed from links inside the main project, will be opened in a floating layer;
web pages:
, move caret between visual objects (ignoring structural objects);
, or use hinting for text input and other widgets, text and other elements like images and videos;

modal key_bindings;
modes (normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive;
press "esc" to go to normal mode;
in normal mode we can:
, press "space" to go to insert mode;
, move the cursor to the next or previous word;
, move the cursor to the next or previous lines or table cells;
, move the cursor to the next or previous paragraph;
, start and end selection, then copy or cut;
, paste
, undo
, find

double space, not at the beginning of line: auto_completion
