= command based user interface
command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are
  faster, more convenient and more powerful
  than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen);

although touch interfaces can still be useful in simple limited applications;
  also for some special artistic applications, pen input remains the only choice;
touch interface may seem very convenient at first sight,
  especially if accompanied with the power of gestures;
but the problem is the form_factor:
 since interaction at a distance is not possible, one must always carry the whole system;

detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
  because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands;
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources;
  also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit,
    that can be put in the pocket;
  this makes the headset lighter and safer;
for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk,
  gesture based (2d) input can be implemented;

= Comshell
Comshell is a unified computing environment, with command based user interface;

a pannel at the left shows the files in the project;
   we can move between files, and copy/rename/delete/create them;
when we want to see the list of projects, a list will be opened on top of this left pannel;
projects are directories inside "~/projects/";

text files are opened in a text editor panel at the right;
directories with ".m" extension are opened in a panel at the right,
  showing thumbnails of the files in it;

non_local projects, web pages, pdf documents, etc,
  can be opened (in a floating layer) and accessed from links inside the main project;
projects inside external disks (in a directory named "projects")
  can be accessed in a pannel, and will be opened in a floating layer;

scroll by paragraph: scroll to reveal the whole paragraph;

modal key_bindings;
modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive;
press escape to go back to normal mode;
in normal mode we can:
, move the cursor to the next or previous characters or words
, move the cursor to the next or previous
  (or by entering the number directly to) lines (or table cells)
, move the cursor to the next or previous paragraphs
, start and end selection, then copy or cut
, paste
, undo, redo
, find
, enter insert mode
