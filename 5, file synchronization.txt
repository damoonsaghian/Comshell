the problem of shared mutable data is so pervasive in the computing world;
we can also see it in file synchronization tools like Git:
, there can be conflicts when pushing or pulling, that must be resolved manually;
, the history just grows indefinitely cause change in the history of the repository can be catastrophic;

solution:
only the owner can mutate the repository;
each file or directory can have an owner;
owner can mutably borrow its content for a defined duration, or move ownership;
others have to send messages:
, in the form of to_dos define by the owner;
, corrections

immutable repositories can apply corrections and to_dos, and test them,
  but they can't push it to remote, only the owner can;
automatic sync at the immutable ends;
sync before sending to_dos or corrections;

Rsync, Rdiff-backup, Duplicity: they don't handle renames, and they only support SSH
  which has complicated verification for server identity;
Unison: it handles renames but instead of moving it copies and deletes in remote, and only supports SSH;
Bup, Borg: they handle renames, but only supports SSH;
Kopia: it handles renames, but only supports:
, SFTP which like SSH has complicated verification for server identity;
, cloud storage which has no proper way to share a definite URL for a repo to the public;
Rclone: it handles renames only when using SFTP or cloud storage;
Restic: it handles renames even without the cloud storage backends, using its REST server;
