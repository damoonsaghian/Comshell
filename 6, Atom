we can use Atom text editor to create a prototype of Comshell;

one pane per project;
only the active project's pane is displayed;
state of each project pane is stored/restored to/from ".cache/atom-pane";
state of buffers in each project pane is stored/restored to/from
  files in ".cache/atom-buffers/" directory;

; cp Atom/* ~/.atom/
set your time_zone in "~/.atom/config.cson";
