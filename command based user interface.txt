command based user interfaces (keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster more convenient and more powerful than pointing based user interfaces (mouse, touch, pen)
pointing interfaces can be useful only for very simple tasks, also for some special artistic applications pen input remains the only choice

to enter missing characters, type bellow characters after a comma, then type a space (note that the resulting characters don't contain the space entered at the end)
  , --> .
  ,, --> :
  ( --> [
  ' --> "
  a --> A
  add --> +
  psi --> ψ
  lambda' --> Λ

Vim'like key'bindings
modes (like normal mode and insert mode) must be visually distinctive, such that user can be certain about which one he is in
pressing "esc" key always take you back to normal mode

command based interactions are much simpler for a speech recognition engine to process, since it needs to match against a relatively small set of commands, unlike a general speech to text process
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources
also it is better to put battery and bluetooth of the headset in a separate unit, that can be put in the pocket, this makes the headset lighter and safer
for those that neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based interface can be implemented
